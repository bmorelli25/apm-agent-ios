=== Additional Components
APM Agents work in conjunction with the {apm-server-ref-v}/index.html[APM Server], {ref}/index.html[{es}], and {kibana-ref}/index.html[{kib}].
The {apm-overview-ref-v}/index.html[APM Overview] provides details on how these components work together,
and provides a matrix outlining {apm-overview-ref-v}/agent-server-compatibility.html[Agent and Server compatibility].
